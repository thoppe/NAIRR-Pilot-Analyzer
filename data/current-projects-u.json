      "abstract": "This proposal requests computational resources on TACC Frontera to advance a transformative project in agriculture: developing a robust foundational vision model for pest identification (insects, weeds, and diseases). It builds on preliminary work with InsectNet, a model trained on a large dataset of insect images, to expand its capabilities significantly. The team aims to utilize an expanded dataset of approximately 100 million images and incorporate new architectures, including transformers, to enhance model accuracy, scalability, and robustness. A key innovation is the introduction of certified robustness to ensure model reliability against adversarial attacks, making it a crucial tool for improving agricultural outcomes globally. This project is supported by the USDA-NIFA and NSF-funded AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture and an NSF CPS Frontiers grant, underscoring its importance and potential impact on sustainable food production.",

Indeed, given their resource constraints, compressed versions of AI systems will be deployed more often and ensuring their safety and robustness is important. To be effective, model compression methods must maintain predictive accuracy, while ensuring out-of-domain robustness. Furthermore, the resulting models should not show disparate predictive performance across societal groups.

      "abstract": "I am a postdoctoral trainee on a TL1 grant doing research and learning machine learning tools for causal inference. This research aims to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis, a heterogenous life-threatening response to infection characterized by organ dysfunction and immune dysregulation; it impacts millions of people annually worldwide and has a 15-30% mortality. Early intravenous fluid administration and vasopressors remain the hallmarks of sepsis-associated hypotension and shock treatment. However, high-quality evidence for any specific initial fluid resuscitation strategy is lacking. Nonetheless, Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) recommend an initial 30 cc/Kg ideal body weight (IBW) fluid administration within 3 hours of diagnosis and, if hypotension persists, vasopressor initiation within 6 hours of diagnosis. To determine whether this approach is, indeed, beneficial for patients with sepsis, we propose to conduct this retrospective observational cohort study to estimate the average fluid volume and administration rate that is associated with the lowest hospital mortality for most patients, using Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Longitudinal TMLE (LTMLE) with the ensemble machine learner SuperLearner (SL).",

      "abstract": "Generative AI has greatly expanded the scope of automation in complex tasks. Many day-to-day digital tasks require interacting with tools via APIs to solve problems in a step-by-step manner. For example, paying what we owe friends for a night out involves using apps such as Splitwise, emails, and Venmo. Many such common activities are complex tasks, requiring our interaction with multiple applications. If LLMs can be augmented with API-based access to these apps, we can automate such complex tasks. There have been significant advances in LLM tool use, and an increased push for automation in solving complex tasks. ChatGPT Plugins, for example, aim to support real-time information retrieval, access to specific knowledge bases, and perform actions such as booking a flight on behalf of a user. There is vast potential for solving a wide variety of complex tasks through such LLM-based automation. However, translating this potential into viable and verified real-world solutions requires both substantial advances in model capabilities and rigorous evaluation in a controllable environment. To this end, this team has already developed, AppWorld, an execution environment, a collection of complex tasks, and programmatic evaluation to verify the correctness of the solutions exhaustively. Benchmarking results show that standard ways of applying state-of-the-art models are unreliable and ineffective for these tasks. This proposal is aimed at developing and training reliable LLM-based agents using three approaches: (i) Supervising LLMs with iterative bootstrapping of tasks, (ii) Learning with feedback from the programmatic evaluator, and (iii) Learning via self-exploration within the execution environment.",

However, security issues in advanced and instruction-tuned code LLMs like WizardCoder and CodeLlama have yet to be investigated.\n\nTo address this gap, the project aims to systematically uncover novel vulnerabilities and attack vectors introduced by instruction-tuned code LLMs, providing fundamental insights into their implications for cybersecurity and AI-incorporated software engineering workflows. The proposed work represents the first comprehensive investigation into the risks of code injection attacks against instruction-tuned code LLMs. Furthermore, we will develop a technique for identifying adversarial threats against instruction-tuned code LLMs, involving the detection of adversarially manipulated inputs and generated code before execution.",

Our research in eco-KGML also makes a distinct departure from mainstream practices of building black-box AI models, that solely rely on supervision contained in data, to also leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge available in many domains including aquatic sciences (e.g., conservation laws of mass and energy) in diverse formats (as equations, rules, heuristics, or as mechanistic model runs) and with varying fidelities of knowledge (ranging from perfect and complete to imperfect and partial). Inspired by the success of large-scale foundation models in mainstream applications of computer vision and language understanding in the commercial arena, the domain of aquatic sciences is ripe with opportunities to investigate the effectiveness of foundation models for modeling scientific processes using both scientific knowledge and data.",

Our goal is to leverage the NAIRR infrastructure to make it possible for data holders to contribute their data to an SDG process without disclosing that data in an unencrypted manner.

The evaluation will assess the performance of each model across relevant metrics, providing standardized findings for comparison.

We will develop unsupervised unified representations, for generative and discriminative tasks, to be used as general-purpose representations for various downstream tasks like image recognition, reconstruction, and synthesis.

      "abstract": "The Arctic is experiencing more rapid warming than many other regions leading to degradation of permafrost, - the permanently frozen earth materials that remain at 0\u00b0C or below for two or more consecutive years-, at an alarming rate. Widespread permafrost thaw induced disturbances negatively impact an array of natural processes, altering hydrology, vegetation dynamics and biogeochemical fluxes, and posing serious threat to human-built environment by damaging buildings and critical infrastructure sitting on permafrost-affected ground.  Permafrost thaw disturbances and microtopographic transitions are no longer localized phenomena but extend across the Arctic. Conventional field surveys and local-scale monitoring mechanisms are unable to offer synoptic assessments of permafrost degradations and ramifications on natural and human-built environments.  Consequently, there is a dire need for new monitoring tools to precisely map permafrost landforms and thaw disturbances and monitor their changes over time and assess the permafrost thaw risk on human-built infrastructure. \nPermafrost dominated landscape in the Arctic harbor a variety of distinctive landforms shaped by the freezing and thawing of the ground.  Ice-wedge polygons (IWPs), the most conspicuous and critical microtopographic formation found in the cold continuous permafrost regions, are underlain by several meter-wide and deep ice-wedges that form a network across the tundra. The microtopography associated with IWPs dictates the Arctic ecosystem from local to regional scales due to the impacts on the flow and storage of water and consequently alter vegetation and carbon dynamics. Field and remote sensing-based studies reported ice-wedge degradation transformation of low-centered polygons into high-centered polygons due to permafrost thaw at several locations across the Arctic tundra. Spatially patchy and temporally sparse knowledge on ice-wedge polygon system's dynamics inevitably lead to uncertainties in regional and pan-Arctic estimates of carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Closing such critical information gaps and improving multi-scale models require objective and detailed geospatial data sets consolidating the ice wedge polygon extent and their prevailing successional stages.\nThe entire Arctic has been imaged by sub-meter resolution Maxar satellite sensors multiple times during the last two decades. Data repositories holding millions of Maxar images are now at petabyte scale. However, comprehensive Pan-Arctic science products derived from this imagery are scarce. This is largely due to data size (big data) and semantic complexity of satellite images. With the funding from NSF Polar Programs (award #s: 1927723, 1827872, 1927720), we pursue the first-of-its-kind permafrost science use case that capitalizes on a large volume of commercial satellite imagery to create the first Pan-Artic scale ice-wedge polygon map covering > 5 million km2 in the Arctic. We harnessed thousands of Maxar imagery, deep learning CNNs, and high-performance computing resources to develop a scalable and reproducible image-to-assessment pipeline. The operational implementation of our mapping pipeline on high-performance computing systems has detected more than one billion individual IWPs. The deep learning model predictions comprise spatial outlining of IWPs coupled with their classification and geometrical attributes at individual IWP-level. The resulting Pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon map holds significant potential to serve a diverse user community, facilitating a deeper understanding of the intricate and interconnected processes governing the evolution of the ice-wedge polygon tundra landscape. \nThe technical goal of this proposal is to improve the performance of our GeoAI pipeline by integrating vision transformers and extending its capabilities to map other important features. Self-attention-based neural net architectures, in particular Transformers have shown extraordinary success in multiple domains, especially in natural language processing (e.g., Chat GPT). Since foundation models are trained on internet-scale training data sets, they can be generalized with zero-shot and few-shot learning to a new task. The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) is an attempt to come out with a foundation model for image segmentation tasks. SAM enables image segmentation without having to train the model on a large set of training samples (zero-shot learning). As with ChatGPT, SAM also uses a transformer-based approach. DL is rapidly moving away from the CNN-based computer vision models to vision transformers (ViTs). Currently, ViT-based models exhibit great promise on benchmark segmentation datasets. However, one major challenge is in adopting ViTs from everyday images to be able to segment geo-objects in high resolution satellite images. Continued access to HPC resources is critical for us to improve the existing DL pipelines via the introduction of new technologies, training and tuning of models, and to create new geospatial map products and reach our new aims successfully. The central objective of this proposal is to request HPC resources that are necessary to develop, train and validate transformer-based AI models.",

This project will develop a large test suite of datasets corresponding to socially relevant concepts.  We will then use these datasets to probe a suite of LLMs to determine for which concepts and models the linear representation hypothesis holds.  In those cases, we will examine the resulting linear representations for evidence of undesirable interaction, for example, through interference due to superposition.

      "abstract": "This proposal explores the evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, LLaMa, and PaLM, which have revolutionized areas including ChatBot interaction, time series forecasting, and code generation. Central to LLMs' effectiveness is the scale of their architecture and the extent of training data. However, the reliance on extensive, diverse datasets challenges the capacity of public data, necessitating the integration of private domain data. This integration, while promising, is hindered by privacy and competitive concerns. To navigate these challenges, the proposal emphasizes Federated Learning (FL) for LLMs. FL enables decentralized training across multiple private domains without relocating the data, addressing privacy issues. Yet, FL introduces systemic challenges, such as hardware heterogeneity and connectivity variances, which can compromise training effectiveness. Additionally, privacy concerns in FL are amplified in LLMs due to the influential role of fewer participants, raising the risk of peer-to-peer data breaches. The research focuses on two key areas: developing a Scalable Federated Learning System for LLMs and formulating a Security and Privacy Preserving Algorithm for their training. This approach aims to refine federated training processes and algorithms, setting a benchmark in federated LLM training. The anticipated outcome is a versatile, secure federated learning framework applicable across various domains, demonstrating the extensive potential of FL in advancing LLMs.",

However, with the rise of large language models, many models are too large to fit and train on-device in FL pipelines. Various solutions have been explored, including training sparse subsets of parameters on-device. In this proposal, we study a different paradigm for training foundation models from distributed, private client data: private synthetic data. We aim to study whether distributed clients can help a central server generate private synthetic data that can be used to centrally fine-tune foundation models. We hypothesize that this approach can be used to train private language models much more cheaply than  with FL.",

As AI models, including foundation models like ChatGPT, SAM, and Sora, increasingly raise privacy and safety concerns, especially with the unauthorized use of patient data, the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) project aims to pioneer privacy-ensured radiological AI. By embedding invisible noise in over 2 million radiological images from MRI and CT scans, this project will generate label-agnostic UE models that protect medical imaging data against misuse in future AI training, without compromising their clinical utility. The project will leverage cutting-edge UE algorithms, high-performance computing, and Vision Transformer models to achieve its objectives. It addresses the urgent need for robust privacy measures in healthcare data, responding to the risks posed by the repurposing of medical imaging for AI training without explicit consent. The proposal also outlines a comprehensive strategy to overcome the challenges of developing UE models for healthcare, including the need for large-scale medical image datasets and substantial computational resources. Aim 1 focuses on rendering large-scale medical imaging data unlearnable, while Aim 2 assesses the effectiveness of UE models against various target models and advanced defenses. The project plans a six-month timeline to achieve its goals, aiming for outcomes that will be shared in leading academic venues. The success of this NAIRR project is expected to significantly advance the field of AI healthcare data security by utilizing Vanderbilt's clinical imaging data in conjunction with DOE's Leadership Computing Facility. This will lay the groundwork for future collaborations and open new avenues for healthcare and high-performance computing (HPC) AI research, ensuring privacy and intellectual property protections for sensitive healthcare data.",

Specifically, the most responsive instruction following LLMs are the ones that can be most easily jailbroken.\n\nIn our work, we believe that the architecture of the human brain illustrates a critical point, there is a separation between language understanding and moderation.  This is supported by functional mapping studies that show the language understanding center, e.g. Wernicke's area, and speech moderation and production area, Broca's area and surrounding Frontal Lobe, are in two distant and separate areas of the brain.

      "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning approach where multiple data owners, referred to as clients, train a model together under the orchestration of a central server by sharing the model trained on their local datasets instead of sharing the data directly. FL enables creation of more robust models without the exposure of local datasets. However, FL by itself, does not guarantee the privacy of data, because the information extracted from the communication of FL algorithms can be accumulated and utilized to infer the private local data used for training. We developed Argonne Privacy Preserving Federated Learning framework (APPFL), with advances in differential privacy, to enable Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL). We enabled training of AI models in a distributed setting across multiple institutions, where sensitive data are located, with the ability to scale on supercomputing resources to help create robust, trust-worthy AI models in biomedicine and smart grid applications where data privacy is essential. Setting up a secure federated learning experiment that needs high performance computational resources across distributed sites requires technical capabilities that may not be available for all. To lower the barrier to entry for leveraging PPFL and to enable domain experts in large institutions to utilize FL, we created the Argonne Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning as a service (APPFLx), which enables cross-silo PPFL using easy to use web interface for managing, deploying, analyzing, and visualizing PPFL experiments. \n\nAPPFLx enables secure federations using end-to-end strong Identity and Access Management, where members can create a new federation or join an existing federation using their institutional identities, perform privacy-preserving training on datasets at their respective institutions and securely share the model weights with the service to enable secure aggregation. Existing PPFL frameworks typically involve downloading and configuring complex software, manually creating trust boundaries and identities to enable gradient aggregation, understanding of technical details of underlying deep learning software stack to enable distributed training which is cumbersome. \n\nAPPFLx features include secure distributed training on heterogenous computing resources, choice of over half a dozen federation strategies, including synchronous and asynchronous strategies, integration with TensorBoard capabilities, interfaces to examine data distributions and resource consumption across different sites, detailed reports of different experiments, ability to use model architectures from GitHub or pre-trained models from HuggingFace model repository and the ability to set different hyperparameters of the experiments (like privacy budget to be used in training). \n\nIn this proposal, we aim to create new AI models, fine-tune existing LLMs for biomedical tasks, evaluate various communication, privacy and performance issues inherent in FL.",

We plan to leverage and refine large vision-language models that can act as proxy preferences of humans via human feedback.

      "abstract": "DeepFake, a term increasingly mentioned in the news and social media, refers to highly realistic fake images, audios, and videos created using AI algorithms.  By creating illusions of an individual's activities that did not occur in reality, DeepFakes can cause serious harm when they are weaponized. The recent detectors often show good results in intra-domain testing,  where training and testing data are generated using identical forgery techniques. However, real-world scenarios often involve testing data created via unknown forgery methods, differing from the training data. This discrepancy leads to subpar cross-domain detection performance, exemplifying the generalization problem in DeepFake detection. This issue poses a major hurdle for the practical application of existing detection methods. Without such generalization, the current DeepFake detection methods are failing to recognize DeepFakes generated by DeepFake makers using new or evolving techniques and therefore are susceptible to obsolescence easily. This project requests the NAIRR Pilot resources to enhance generalization in detecting novel DeepFakes, aligning with NAIRR's focus area on advancing Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI and the core research aim of Improving accuracy, validity, and reliability of model performance, while controlling bias. The project's findings will be disseminated through publications in prestigious conferences and journals. All algorithms developed throughout this project will be made openly accessible as open-source software on GitHub.",

However, observations of discharge and groundwater levels are limited at the subcatchment level, and using hydrologic modeling directly at the subcatchment scale without observations will not provide realistic predictions. To address this sparse data gap, this project aims to simulate stochastic hydrologic responses across 2,000 mountainous hillslopes under various climate scenarios and uncertain subsurface and surface properties. The baseline mountainous hillslope model we used has integrated intensive geophysical and hydrologic datasets. The simulated 2,000 hydrologic responses become an AI-ready dataset to benchmark realistic hydrologic variations. Additionally, leveraging the Neural Operator, we plan to develop a fast AI surrogate model to quickly predict snowpack, discharge, and groundwater levels, substituting time-intensive hydrologic simulations. This pilot study not only advances hillslope hydrologic models by incorporating realistic subsurface and surface uncertainties but also contributes an openly accessible hydrologic dataset and a pretrained AI model for rapid hydrologic forecasting in mountainous regions, supporting water budgeting and climate impact assessments.",

An ideal interpretable model should be able to produce symbolic representations understandable by humans (e.g., what diseases and symptoms each variable in the model represents), conform to conditional dependencies in the real world (e.g., whether the customer's purchase is affected by the product's price drop), and handle uncertainty in data (e.g., how certain the model is about the rainfall tomorrow). Unfortunately, DL as a connectionist approach does not natively support any of these desiderata.\n\nThis project aims to develop two sets of methodologies grounded in Bayesian deep learning: (1) \"Bayesian Deep Interpreters,\" which will interpret deep learning models through the use of graphical models that describe the conditional dependencies leading to current predictions. (2) \"Bayesian Deep Controllers,\" which will manage the predictions of deep learning models by adjusting specific random variables within the graphical models associated with the controlled models.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the off-the-shelf model for unsupervised domain adaptation (OSUDA) has been introduced to protect patient data privacy and intellectual property of the source domain without access to the labeled source domain data. Yet, our recent works found that an off-the-shelf (OS) diagnosis model, deliberately compromised by backdoor/Trojan attacks during the source domain training phase, can function as a parasite-host, disseminating the backdoor to the target domain model during the OSUDA stage. Therefore, backdoor attacks can pose a serious threat to the reliability of the target domain medical analysis systems. To our knowledge, this is the pioneer attempt at addressing backdoor attacks in medical image analysis for OSUDA. In this project, we propose to quantify the channel-wise backdoor sensitivity, and eliminate the backdoor infection by overwriting the backdoor-related channels to cut-off the infection. If it is successful, the project will have great potential to achieve a secured, privacy-protected, and cross-center generalizable AI system for medical image analysis.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale scientific simulations drive scientific and engineering discovery across many domains, but face performance problems. These simulations typically involve complex physics computations, such as (non-)linear programming problems in transportation, manufacturing, robotics, power grids, and renewable energy systems, which causes unaffordable running time. However, the computation components in the simulations are difficult to scale efficiently on high-performance hardware. \n\nIn the next decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) may revolutionize the natural sciences, enhancing our capacity to model and predict natural occurrences. This could herald a new era of scientific exploration, bringing significant advancements across sectors from drug development to renewable energy.  By employing reverse-engineering and automatic learning methodologies it is often possible to solve complex, unstructured problems with a fraction of the computing power and execution time needed by traditional direct and first-principle methods. A deep neural network provides researchers with a powerful tool to learn the structure of physical phenomena directly from Nature, rather than having to explain the causal relationships through the direct application of physics law. Researchers have found that using AI techniques to act as surrogates for the computation-intensive parts of High-performance Computing (HPC) programs can achieve excellent accelerations.",
