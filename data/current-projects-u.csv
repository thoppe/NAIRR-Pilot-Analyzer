Malicious user prompts or training data attacks may result in AI-generated code containing software backdoors, logic corruption, unauthorized code execution, and other malicious behavior or software exploits. Previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating the robustness of large pre-trained code models like CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and CodeT5 against adversarial examples in tasks such as code clone detection, vulnerability identification, and authorship attribution. However, security issues in advanced and instruction-tuned code LLMs like WizardCoder and CodeLlama have yet to be investigated.

To address this gap, the project aims to systematically uncover novel vulnerabilities and attack vectors introduced by instruction-tuned code LLMs, providing fundamental insights into their implications for cybersecurity and AI-incorporated software engineering workflows. The proposed work represents the first comprehensive investigation into the risks of code injection attacks against instruction-tuned code LLMs. Furthermore, we will develop a technique for identifying adversarial threats against instruction-tuned code LLMs, involving the detection of adversarially manipulated inputs and generated code before execution.",2024-04-26T12:55:13.421Z

FL enables creation of more robust models without the exposure of local datasets. However, FL by itself, does not guarantee the privacy of data, because the information extracted from the communication of FL algorithms can be accumulated and utilized to infer the private local data used for training. We developed Argonne Privacy Preserving Federated Learning framework (APPFL), with advances in differential privacy, to enable Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL). We enabled training of AI models in a distributed setting across multiple institutions, where sensitive data are located, with the ability to scale on supercomputing resources to help create robust, trust-worthy AI models in biomedicine and smart grid applications where data privacy is essential. Setting up a secure federated learning experiment that needs high performance computational resources across distributed sites requires technical capabilities that may not be available for all. To lower the barrier to entry for leveraging PPFL and to enable domain experts in large institutions to utilize FL, we created the Argonne Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning as a service (APPFLx), which enables cross-silo PPFL using easy to use web interface for managing, deploying, analyzing, and visualizing PPFL experiments. 

APPFLx enables secure federations using end-to-end strong Identity and Access Management, where members can create a new federation or join an existing federation using their institutional identities, perform privacy-preserving training on datasets at their respective institutions and securely share the model weights with the service to enable secure aggregation. Existing PPFL frameworks typically involve downloading and configuring complex software, manually creating trust boundaries and identities to enable gradient aggregation, understanding of technical details of underlying deep learning software stack to enable distributed training which is cumbersome. 

APPFLx features include secure distributed training on heterogenous computing resources, choice of over half a dozen federation strategies, including synchronous and asynchronous strategies, integration with TensorBoard capabilities, interfaces to examine data distributions and resource consumption across different sites, detailed reports of different experiments, ability to use model architectures from GitHub or pre-trained models from HuggingFace model repository and the ability to set different hyperparameters of the experiments (like privacy budget to be used in training).

By creating illusions of an individual's activities that did not occur in reality, DeepFakes can cause serious harm when they are weaponized. The recent detectors often show good results in intra-domain testing,  where training and testing data are generated using identical forgery techniques. However, real-world scenarios often involve testing data created via unknown forgery methods, differing from the training data. This discrepancy leads to subpar cross-domain detection performance, exemplifying the generalization problem in DeepFake detection. This issue poses a major hurdle for the practical application of existing detection methods. Without such generalization, the current DeepFake detection methods are failing to recognize DeepFakes generated by DeepFake makers using new or evolving techniques and therefore are susceptible to obsolescence easily. This project requests the NAIRR Pilot resources to enhance generalization in detecting novel DeepFakes, aligning with NAIRR's focus area on advancing Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI and the core research aim of Improving accuracy, validity, and reliability of model performance, while controlling bias.

As AI models, including foundation models like ChatGPT, SAM, and Sora, increasingly raise privacy and safety concerns, especially with the unauthorized use of patient data, the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) project aims to pioneer privacy-ensured radiological AI. By embedding invisible noise in over 2 million radiological images from MRI and CT scans, this project will generate label-agnostic UE models that protect medical imaging data against misuse in future AI training, without compromising their clinical utility. The project will leverage cutting-edge UE algorithms, high-performance computing, and Vision Transformer models to achieve its objectives. It addresses the urgent need for robust privacy measures in healthcare data, responding to the risks posed by the repurposing of medical imaging for AI training without explicit consent. The proposal also outlines a comprehensive strategy to overcome the challenges of developing UE models for healthcare, including the need for large-scale medical image datasets and substantial computational resources. Aim 1 focuses on rendering large-scale medical imaging data unlearnable, while Aim 2 assesses the effectiveness of UE models against various target models and advanced defenses. The project plans a six-month timeline to achieve its goals, aiming for outcomes that will be shared in leading academic venues. The success of this NAIRR project is expected to significantly advance the field of AI healthcare data security by utilizing Vanderbilt's clinical imaging data in conjunction with DOE's Leadership Computing Facility.

We will develop unsupervised unified representations, for generative and discriminative tasks, to be used as general-purpose representations for various downstream tasks like image recognition, reconstruction, and synthesis.

Widespread permafrost thaw induced disturbances negatively impact an array of natural processes, altering hydrology, vegetation dynamics and biogeochemical fluxes, and posing serious threat to human-built environment by damaging buildings and critical infrastructure sitting on permafrost-affected ground.  Permafrost thaw disturbances and microtopographic transitions are no longer localized phenomena but extend across the Arctic. Conventional field surveys and local-scale monitoring mechanisms are unable to offer synoptic assessments of permafrost degradations and ramifications on natural and human-built environments.  Consequently, there is a dire need for new monitoring tools to precisely map permafrost landforms and thaw disturbances and monitor their changes over time and assess the permafrost thaw risk on human-built infrastructure. 
Permafrost dominated landscape in the Arctic harbor a variety of distinctive landforms shaped by the freezing and thawing of the ground.  Ice-wedge polygons (IWPs), the most conspicuous and critical microtopographic formation found in the cold continuous permafrost regions, are underlain by several meter-wide and deep ice-wedges that form a network across the tundra. The microtopography associated with IWPs dictates the Arctic ecosystem from local to regional scales due to the impacts on the flow and storage of water and consequently alter vegetation and carbon dynamics. Field and remote sensing-based studies reported ice-wedge degradation transformation of low-centered polygons into high-centered polygons due to permafrost thaw at several locations across the Arctic tundra. Spatially patchy and temporally sparse knowledge on ice-wedge polygon system's dynamics inevitably lead to uncertainties in regional and pan-Arctic estimates of carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Closing such critical information gaps and improving multi-scale models require objective and detailed geospatial data sets consolidating the ice wedge polygon extent and their prevailing successional stages.
The entire Arctic has been imaged by sub-meter resolution Maxar satellite sensors multiple times during the last two decades. Data repositories holding millions of Maxar images are now at petabyte scale. However, comprehensive Pan-Arctic science products derived from this imagery are scarce. This is largely due to data size (big data) and semantic complexity of satellite images. With the funding from NSF Polar Programs (award #s: 1927723, 1827872, 1927720), we pursue the first-of-its-kind permafrost science use case that capitalizes on a large volume of commercial satellite imagery to create the first Pan-Artic scale ice-wedge polygon map covering > 5 million km2 in the Arctic. We harnessed thousands of Maxar imagery, deep learning CNNs, and high-performance computing resources to develop a scalable and reproducible image-to-assessment pipeline. The operational implementation of our mapping pipeline on high-performance computing systems has detected more than one billion individual IWPs. The deep learning model predictions comprise spatial outlining of IWPs coupled with their classification and geometrical attributes at individual IWP-level. The resulting Pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon map holds significant potential to serve a diverse user community, facilitating a deeper understanding of the intricate and interconnected processes governing the evolution of the ice-wedge polygon tundra landscape. 
The technical goal of this proposal is to improve the performance of our GeoAI pipeline by integrating vision transformers and extending its capabilities to map other important features. Self-attention-based neural net architectures, in particular Transformers have shown extraordinary success in multiple domains, especially in natural language processing (e.g., Chat GPT). Since foundation models are trained on internet-scale training data sets, they can be generalized with zero-shot and few-shot learning to a new task. The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) is an attempt to come out with a foundation model for image segmentation tasks. SAM enables image segmentation without having to train the model on a large set of training samples (zero-shot learning). As with ChatGPT, SAM also uses a transformer-based approach. DL is rapidly moving away from the CNN-based computer vision models to vision transformers (ViTs). Currently, ViT-based models exhibit great promise on benchmark segmentation datasets. However, one major challenge is in adopting ViTs from everyday images to be able to segment geo-objects in high resolution satellite images. Continued access to HPC resources is critical for us to improve the existing DL pipelines via the introduction of new technologies, training and tuning of models, and to create new geospatial map products and reach our new aims successfully. The central objective of this proposal is to request HPC resources that are necessary to develop, train and validate transformer-based AI models.",2024-04-26T14:37:37.922Z

Many such common activities are complex tasks, requiring our interaction with multiple applications. If LLMs can be augmented with API-based access to these apps, we can automate such complex tasks.
